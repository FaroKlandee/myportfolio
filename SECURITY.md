# Security Documentation

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the portfolio website and provides recommendations for further improvements.

## Implemented Security Measures

### 1. Environment Variables

- Sensitive information has been moved from hardcoded values to environment variables
- Contact information, API endpoints, and social media links are now stored in `.env.local`
- Session secret is stored securely in environment variables

### 2. CSRF Protection

- Implemented CSRF protection using iron-session
- CSRF tokens are generated for each session and validated on form submission
- API endpoint `/api/csrf` generates tokens that are stored in encrypted session cookies
- Form submissions require a valid CSRF token that matches the one in the session

### 3. Security Headers

- Added comprehensive security headers via Next.js middleware
- Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent XSS attacks
- X-Content-Type-Options to prevent MIME type sniffing
- X-Frame-Options to prevent clickjacking
- X-XSS-Protection for additional XSS protection in older browsers
- Referrer-Policy to control referrer information
- Permissions-Policy to limit feature usage
- Strict-Transport-Security to enforce HTTPS

### 4. Form Security

- Client-side validation with clear error messages
- Server-side validation to ensure data integrity
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse (10 requests per minute per IP)
- Improved error handling with specific error messages

### 5. External Link Security

- Added `rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"` to external links
- Prevents target site from accessing window.opener
- Prevents referrer information leakage
- Prevents SEO impact from untrusted links

## Known Issues

### 1. Insecure Dependencies

The security scan has identified a critical vulnerability in the Next.js dependency. This is a known issue in the current version of Next.js (15.1.3). To address this:

- Monitor the Next.js GitHub repository for security updates
- Update to a patched version once available
- Consider implementing additional security measures to mitigate the specific vulnerability
- Run `npm audit` regularly to check for updates on this issue

## Recommendations for Further Improvements

### 1. Authentication

- Implement proper authentication for admin access if needed
- Consider using NextAuth.js for secure authentication
- Use strong password policies and MFA where applicable

### 2. Data Protection

- Implement data encryption for sensitive stored information
- Consider using a more secure method for sharing CV than public Google Drive link
- Regularly audit and clean up personal information

### 3. Infrastructure Security

- Deploy with HTTPS only (enforced by Strict-Transport-Security header)
- Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities
- Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Implement proper logging and monitoring for security events

### 4. Form Handling

- Consider implementing honeypot fields to catch automated submissions
- Add CAPTCHA for additional protection against bots
- Store form submissions in a secure database with proper access controls

### 5. Content Security

- Regularly audit and update Content Security Policy
- Consider implementing Subresource Integrity for external scripts
- Use trusted CDNs for external resources

### 6. Regular Security Audits

- Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing
- Use automated security scanning tools in CI/CD pipeline
- Keep up with security best practices and emerging threats
